            <img class="float-left" id="elmimage" src="assets/images/elm1.jpg" alt="#">
            <p id="elmtext">This wonderful piece of elm has the potential for big things. It has a lovely void in it, best utilized with a resin fill to add contrast and strength.
                It could be then turned into a number of things. With its shape it would be best suited for a modern live edge coffee table, whether with wooden or thin metal legs. 
                It is roughly 4cm x 40cm x 100cm in dimensions. <br><br>The main steps in contruction of a project like this would be;
                <ul id="elmlist">
                    <li>Remove all dead material and bark from around the edges and the void</li>
                    <li>Plane to just above the final thickness</li>
                    <li>Prepare and apply the epoxy to the void</li>
                    <li>Clean up the epoxy once the curring has completed</li>
                    <li>Sand all over gradually increasing the grit to achieve desired result</li>
                    <li>Prepare and affix the legs</li>
                    <li>Apply the finish and repeat until the desired level of sheen is reached</li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <img class="float-right" id="oakimage" src="assets/images/oakslabs.jpg" alt="#">
        <p id="oaktext">This lovely pair of chunky oak slabs have many features like, an unusual shape, vivid grain and a lovely feature crack.
            These would make a fetching pair of matching side tables, even incorporating a colored resin to help strengthen and enhance the crack. An alternative
            to the resin could be the use of bow ties to join the two sides of the crack giving strength and an aestetic impact. <br>
            If you wanted to push the boundaries you could incorporate some under surface led lighting and maybe even 
            a wireless charger. Minimilist legs would finish this item off nicely. <br> Rough dimensions of each piece is 4cm x 30cm x 30cm.
        </p>

        <div>
            <img class="float-left" id="elm-two-image" src="assets/images/elm2.jpg" alt="#">
        <p id="elm-two-text"> When we saw this lovely piece of elm in the sawmill I knew it had great potential. Our first thought was for a desk top. Whilst it looks a bit
            narrow in the present form, with a bit of wood-workers magic we believe that this could be a head turner in any office. 
            Rough dimensions of this piece are 3cm x 35cm x 190cm.<br> Simplistic construction method:
            <ul id="elm-two-list">
                <li>Mark out and cut the piece into two halves, lengthways.</li>
                <li>Make resin mould and complete pour.</li>
                <li>Trim resin and wood to finished length.</li>
                <li>Sand top all over, increasing the grip to achieve a smooth finish.</li>
                <li>Craft and join legs to top.</li>
                <li>Apply a finishing product, oil, wax, or a combination of both!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
