## Wireframes

The wireframes for Wawas Woods were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

## Site Structure

Wawas Woods website has four pages. The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page, [projects](projects.html), [inspiration](inspiration.html) and [contact](contact.html) pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu. There is another link to the contact page in the 'About-us' section to give the user some guidance to the next step of the journey. 
On every page there is also a 'back to the top arrow' in the bottom left corner.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The fonts chosen were 'Caveat' for the headings and 'Lato' for the body text. They fall back to cursive and sans-serif respectively. 
     *  'Caveat' was chosen for the headings to give the user an inital welcoming feel. The cursive style generally feels more inviting and less intimidating for the user than others.
      * 'Lato' is used for the body text as it provides a nice contrast to the cursive whilst being easy to read for all.

 * ### Colour Scheme
      The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on green and off-white. The colour contrasts with the wood colour in many of the images. Green traditionally gives the impression of energy, safety and growth. This is something that Wawas Woods can hopefully pass onto the user.

# Features

Wawas Woods site is set up to be welcoming and easy to use. It contains many features that the user would probably be familiar with, such as a navigation bar and contact form. The overall feel of the website is intended to be inviting and not intimidating to encourage the user to explore further. 

## Existing Features  
  * ### Navigation Menu

    * Sited at the top of all the pages in the site, it is fully responsive and contains links to all the pages of the site to enable ease of navigation in one convenient location.
    * The logo is clickable with a link back to the home page for enhanced UX.

![Navigation bar image](assets/readme-images/navbar.png)
[Back to top](<#contents>)

  * ### Gallery

      * Located on the home page beneath the title section. It was intended to make the title section relatively plain to enable a focus on the images in the gallery.
      * A responsively styled grid of images of past projects to give the user an idea of what is possible. 

![Gallery image](assets/readme-images/gallery3.png)
[Back to top](<#contents>)

  * ### About-Us
    * The About Us section lets the user know what Wawas Woods is and who we are. 
    * The combination of a family picture and the text will draw the user in further by instilling a confidence that the project will be taken care of by a small family business.
    * An inbedded link to the contact section in the text will help the user navigate quickly to the next step of the project process.

![About-Us image](assets/readme-images/about-us.png)
[Back to top](<#contents>)

  * ### Testimonials

    * The testimonials section provides the user with some feedback from previous clients. There are three testimonials displayed giving a name, project name and some text.
    * They are styled with a box shadow to 'detach' them from the site to instill a sense of impartiality in the user.
    * The testimonals will be updated as more recent testimonials become available.

![Testimonials section image](assets/readme-images/testimonials.png)
[Back to top](<#contents>)

* ### Footer
    
    * Contains social media links. To enhance the UX the links open in other tabs.
    * The social media presence will help the user with their research into Wawas Woods and will also encourage them to connect with Wawas Woods.
    * To help the user with navigation on all devices a 'scroll to the top' arrow was added. It sticks to the bottom left of the screen at all times to give the user a quick and unobstructed way to the navigation bar. The arrow is semi-transparent with a light/dark contrasting border for use against all background colours.
    * The GitHub and LinkedIn social links are there for the educational side of this project. They would be removed if this site was deployed outside of this project.

* ### Projects

    * The projects page give the user an idea of the recent projects that have been worked on. It also shows a number of different wood working techniques and finishes to help inspire the user's design.
    * There are images of the recent projects. To help enhance the UX two slideshows have been added to allow the user to see more images of two of the pieces.
    * This section would be updated periodically to reflect new recently finished projects.

![Projects page image](assets/readme-images/projects3.png)
[Back to top](<#contents>)

* ### Inspiration
    * The inspiration page is mainly there to demonstrate how a project starts and what is required to transform it into a finished project. It should inspire the user with the images of unfinished wood and get the user to imagine how that would look as a finished product.
    * It also contains a brief description of how the project would be constructed to give the user a rough idea of what goes on behind the scenes.

![Inspiration page image](assets/readme-images/inspiration.png)

* ### Contact Us

    * This section should complete the online journey for the user. It has a map (location of real life workshop not shown due to privacy reasons), address, phone number and email address details.
    * In case the user would like to contact Wawas Woods directly there is an e-mail link icon. It opens the user's default email provider with an email addressed to Wawas Woods.
    * There is a form that the user can choose to fill in. It has 5 input fields, name, email, address, callback and a textarea. The call back button lets Wawas Woods know if the user would like a callback.

    * This would incorporate an e-commerce platform and an enhanced gallery page.
* An option to live stream the workshop.
    * Particularly of interest to those whose projects are underway.

# Acknowledgements
The site was completed as a Portfolio 1 Project piece for the Full Stack Software Developer (e-Commerce) Diploma at the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). As such I would like to thank my mentor [Precious Ijege](https://www.linkedin.com/in/precious-ijege-908a00168/), the Slack community, and all at the Code Institute for their help and support. Wawas Woods is a fictional company but it exists in everything but the business title. Currently it is more of a hobby!
