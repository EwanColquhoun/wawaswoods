## Wireframes

The wireframes for Wawas Woods were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

## Site Structure

Wawas Woods website has four pages. The [home page](/index.html) is the default loading page, [projects](/projects.html), [inspiration](/inspiration.html) and [contact](/contact.html) pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu. There is another link to the contact page in the 'About-us' section to give the user some guidance to the next step of the journey. 
On every page there is also a 'back to the top arrow' in the bottom left corner.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The fonts chosen were 'Caveat' for the headings and 'Lato' for the body text. They fall back to cursive and sans-serif respectively. 
     * <p style="font-family: 'Caveat', cursive;"> 'Caveat' was chosen for the headings to give the user an inital welcoming feel. The cursive style generally feels more inviting and less intimidating for the user than others.</p>
      * <p style="font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;">'Lato' is used for the body text as it provides a nice contrast to the cursive whilst being easy to read for all.</p>

 * ### Colour Scheme
      The color scheme eventually chosen is one based on green and off-white. The colours contrasts with the wood colour in many of the images.
