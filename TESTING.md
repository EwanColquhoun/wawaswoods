# Testing
## Code Validation
The Wawas Woods site has be throughly tested. All the code has been run through the [W3C html Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). A minor error was found on the home page. After a fix and retest, no errors were returned for both. The HTML validator results for each page are below:

* Home page

This was an oversight from the development phase when the font size was being modified. It was easily fixed by using the correct closing tag.
